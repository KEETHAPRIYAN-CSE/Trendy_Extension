# SFX Terminal - Sound Effects Extension 🎵

**Add trendy sound effects to your VS Code terminal!**

Just install and go! SFX Terminal **automatically** plays success and error sounds when your terminal commands finish. No setup, no configuration needed.

## ✨ Features

- 🎵 **Success Sound** - Plays when commands exit with code 0
- 🚨 **Error Sound** - Plays when commands fail (non-zero exit code)
- 🔧 **Task Integration** - Works with VS Code build tasks (npm, webpack, tsc, etc.)
- 🔊 **Native Audio** - Uses Windows built-in `winmm.dll` / Mac `afplay` / Linux `paplay` — no extra installs!
- ⚙️ **Customizable** - Use your own MP3/WAV sound files
- ⚡ **Shell Integration** - Automatic command detection in PowerShell terminals
- 💻 **Cross Platform** - Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 📦 **Zero Config** - Sounds are bundled. Just install and it works!

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Install the extension** from VS Code Marketplace
2. **Open a PowerShell terminal** (View → Terminal)
3. **Run any command** — sounds play automatically!
   - `echo "Hello"` ✅ → Success sound
   - `exit 1` ❌ → Error sound
4. **That's it!** No configuration needed.

## ⚙️ Configuration

This extension provides the following settings:

- `sfxTerminal.enabled`: Enable/disable sound effects (default: true)
- `sfxTerminal.volume`: Volume level 0-100 (default: 100)
- `sfxTerminal.successSound`: Path to custom success sound file
- `sfxTerminal.errorSound`: Path to custom error sound file

## 🔧 Commands

- **SFX: Enable Terminal Audio** - Turn on sound effects
- **SFX: Disable Terminal Audio** - Turn off sound effects  
- **SFX: Test Success Sound** - Play success sound
- **SFX: Test Error Sound** - Play error sound
- **SFX: Trigger Success Sound (Manual)** - Manual success trigger (for fallback)
- **SFX: Trigger Error Sound (Manual)** - Manual error trigger (for fallback)

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (Fallback)

If automatic sounds don't work on your system, use these keyboard shortcuts when terminal is focused:

| Shortcut | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Success Sound | Play success sound manually |
| `Ctrl+Shift+E` | Error Sound | Play error sound manually |

## 🔊 Custom Sounds

Replace the default sounds by:
1. Adding your `.mp3` or `.wav` files to the extension's `sounds/` folder
2. Or specify custom paths in settings:
   ```json
   {
     "sfxTerminal.successSound": "C:/path/to/your/success.mp3",
     "sfxTerminal.errorSound": "C:/path/to/your/error.wav"
   }
   ```

## 💡 Tips

- **PowerShell works best** — CMD has limited shell integration support
- **Build Tasks always work** — `npm run build`, `tsc`, `webpack` etc. trigger sounds even without shell integration
- **Sounds are bundled** — The MP3 files ship inside the extension, nothing extra to download

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No sounds playing?**
1. Check Output panel → "SFX Terminal" for debug logs
2. Ensure shell integration is enabled: Settings → "Terminal Integration"
3. Use PowerShell terminal instead of CMD
4. Test with: Ctrl+Shift+P → "SFX: Test Success Sound"
5. Check that system audio is working (try playing any audio file)

**Shell integration not working? (Enterprise/College systems)**
- Shell integration may be blocked by group policies
- **Use manual keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl+Shift+S` for success, `Ctrl+Shift+E` for error
- Wait 2-3 seconds after opening terminal
- VS Code tasks (npm run build, etc.) still trigger sounds automatically
- Consider switching to PowerShell terminal

## 📚 How It Works

| Platform | Audio Method | Needs Install? |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Windows** | `winmm.dll` (mciSendString) via PowerShell | ❌ No — built into Windows |
| **macOS** | `afplay` command | ❌ No — built into macOS |
| **Linux** | `paplay` / `aplay` / `mpv` / `ffplay` | Usually pre-installed |

## 📝 Requirements

- **VS Code** 1.93.0 or higher
- **PowerShell** terminal recommended (for shell integration)
- **No extra software needed** — uses OS built-in audio!
